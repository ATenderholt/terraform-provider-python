  Package Python code & dependencies into archives suitable for Cloud serverless

# python Provider

The "python" provider simplifies packaging code and dependencies for Cloud serverless functions (e.g. AWS Lambda).
Specifically, it creates an archive for the main code, as well as a separate archive for any dependencies defined
in `requirements.txt` using `pip` to install dependencies.

```hcl
provider "python" {
  pip_command = "pip3.10"
}
```

Note: To ensure stable checksums for dependencies, they should be pinned to specific versions. A tool like 
[`pip-compile`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) will help with transitive dependencies. If you find any examples 
where the checksum for dependency archives are not stable, please let me know.
